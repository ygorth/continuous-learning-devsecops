# API1: 2023 Broken Object Level Authorization

## Overview

This documentation outlines the issue of Broken Object Level Authorization security risk.

## Problem Description

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), also known as Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), is a critical security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate object references to gain unauthorized access to data or resources. This can lead to unauthorized data exposure, data manipulation, and other security breaches.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the risk associated with Broken Object Level Authorization, consider the following best practices:

1. Implement proper access control mechanisms.
2. Use session management and authentication tokens to validate user access to objects.
3. Perform input validation to prevent user manipulation of object references.
4. Regularly monitor and log access to sensitive objects for suspicious activities.
